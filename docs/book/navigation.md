# Using laminas-navigation in your Album Module

In this tutorial we will use the [laminas-navigation component](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-navigation/intro/)
to add a navigation menu to the black bar at the top of the screen, and add
breadcrumbs above the main site content.

## Preparation

In a real world application, the album browser would be only a portion of a
working website. Usually the user would land on a homepage first, and be able to
view albums by using a standard navigation menu. So that we have a site that is
more realistic than just the albums feature, lets make the standard skeleton
welcome page our homepage, with the `/album` route still showing our album module.
In order to make this change, we need to undo some work we did earlier.
Currently, navigating to the root of your app (`/`) routes you to the
`AlbumController`'s default action. Let's undo this route change so we have two
discrete entry points to the app, a home page, and an albums area.

```php
// In module/Application/config/module.config.php:
'home' => [
   'type' => Literal::class,
    'options' => [
        'route'    => '/',
        'defaults' => [
            'controller' => Controller\IndexController::class, // <-- change back here
            'action'     => 'index',
        ],
    ],
],
```

(You can also now remove the import for the `Album\Controller\AlbumController`
class.)

This change means that if you go to the home page of your application
(`http://localhost:8080/` or `http://laminas-mvc-tutorial.localhost/`), you see the
default skeleton application introduction. Your list of albums is still
available at the `/album` route.

## Setting Up laminas-navigation

First, we need to install laminas-navigation. From your root directory, execute the
following:

```bash
$ composer require laminas/laminas-navigation
```

Assuming you followed the [Getting Started tutorial](getting-started/overview.md),
you will be prompted by the [laminas-component-installer](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-component-installer)
plugin to inject `Laminas\Navigation`; be sure to select the option for either
`config/application.config.php` or `config/modules.config.php`; since it is the
only package you are installing, you can answer either "y" or "n" to the "Remember this
option for other packages of the same type" prompt.

> ### Manual configuration
>
> If you are not using laminas-component-installer, you will need to setup
> configuration manually. You can do this in one of two ways:
>
> - Register the `Laminas\Navigation` module in either
>   `config/application.config.php` or `config/modules.config.php`. Make sure
>   you put it towards the top of the module list, before any modules you have
>   defined or third party modules you are using.
> - Alternately, add a new file, `config/autoload/navigation.global.php`, with
>   the following contents:
>
>   ```php
>   <?php
>   use Laminas\Navigation\ConfigProvider;
>   
>   return [
>       'service_manager' => (new ConfigProvider())->getDependencyConfig(),
>   ];
>   ```

Once installed, our application is now aware of laminas-navigation, and even has
some default factories in place, which we will now make use of.

## Configuring our Site Map

Next up, we need laminas-navigation to understand the hierarchy of our site.
To do this, we can add a `navigation` key to our configuration, with the site
structure details. We'll do that in the `Application` module configuration:

```php
// in module/Application/config/module.config.php:
return [
    /* ... */

    'navigation' => [
        'default' => [
            [
                'label' => 'Home',
                'route' => 'home',
                'class' => 'nav-link',
            ],
            [
                'label' => 'Album',
                'route' => 'album',
                'class' => 'nav-link',
                'pages' => [
                    [
                        'label'  => 'Add',
                        'route'  => 'album',
                        'action' => 'add',
                    ],
                    [
                        'label'  => 'Edit',
                        'route'  => 'album',
                        'action' => 'edit',
                    ],
                    [
                        'label'  => 'Delete',
                        'route'  => 'album',
                        'action' => 'delete',
                    ],
                ],
            ],
        ],
    ],

    /* ... */
];
```

This configuration maps out the pages we've defined in our Album module, with
labels linking to the given route names and actions. You can define highly complex
hierarchical sites here with pages and sub-pages linking to route names,
controller/action pairs, or external uris. For more information, see the
[laminas-navigation quick start](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-navigation/quick-start/).

## Adding the Menu View Helper

Now that we have the navigation helper configured by our service manager and
merged config, we can add the menu to the title bar to our layout by
using the [menu view helper](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-navigation/helpers/menu/):

```php
<?php // in module/Application/view/layout/layout.phtml: ?>
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
    <?php // add this: ?>
    <?= $this->navigation('navigation')->menu() ?>
</div>
```

The navigation helper is provided by default with laminas-view, and uses the service
manager configuration we've already defined to configure itself automatically.
Refreshing your application, you will see a working menu; with just a few tweaks
however, we can make it look even better:

```php
<?php // in module/Application/view/layout/layout.phtml: ?>
<div class="collapse navbar-collapse">
    <?php // update to: ?>
    <?= $this->navigation('navigation')
        ->menu()
        ->setMinDepth(0)
        ->setMaxDepth(0)
        ->setUlClass('nav navbar-nav') ?>
</div>
```

Here we tell the renderer to give the root `<ul>` the class of `nav` (so that
Bootstrap styles the menu correctly), and only render the first level of any
given page. If you view your application in your browser, you will now see a
nicely styled menu appear in the title bar.

The great thing about laminas-navigation is that it integrates with laminas-router in
order to highlight the currently viewed page. Because of this, it sets the
active page to have a class of `active` in the menu; Bootstrap uses this to
highlight your current page accordingly.

## Adding Breadcrumbs

Adding breadcrumbs follows the same process. In our `layout.phtml` we want to
add breadcrumbs above the main content pane, so our users know exactly
where they are in our website. Inside the container `<div>`, before we
output the content from the view, let's add a breadcrumb by using the
[breadcrumbs view helper](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-navigation/helpers/breadcrumbs/).

```php
<?php // module/Application/view/layout/layout.phtml: ?>
<div class="container">
    <?php // add the following line: ?>
    <?= $this->navigation('navigation')->breadcrumbs()->setMinDepth(0) ?>
    <?= $this->content ?>
</div>
```

This adds a simple but functional breadcrumb to every page (we tell it to render
from a depth of 0 so we see all page levels), but we can do better than that!
Because Bootstrap has a styled breadcrumb as part of its base CSS, let's add
a partial that outputs the `<ul>` using Bootstrap styles. We'll create it in the
`view` directory of the `Application` module (this partial is application wide,
rather than album specific):

```php
<?php // in module/Application/view/partial/breadcrumb.phtml: ?>
<ul class="breadcrumb">
    <?php
    // iterate through the pages
    foreach ($this->pages as $key => $page):
    ?>
        <?php
        // if this isn't the last page, add a link and the separator:
        if ($key < count($this->pages) - 1):
        ?>
            <li class="breadcrumb-item">
            <a href="<?= $page->getHref() ?>"><?= $page->getLabel() ?></a>
        <?php
        // otherwise, output the name only:
        else:
        ?>
            <li class="breadcrumb-item active" aria-current="page">
            <?= $page->getLabel() ?>
        <?php endif; ?>
        </li>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
```

Notice how the partial is passed a `Laminas\View\Model\ViewModel` instance with the
`pages` property set to an array of pages to render.

Now we need to tell the breadcrumb helper to use the partial we have just
written:

```php
<?php // in module/Application/view/layout/layout.phtml: ?>
<div class="container">
    <?php // Update to: ?>
    <?= $this->navigation('navigation')
            ->breadcrumbs()
            ->setMinDepth(0)
            ->setPartial('partial/breadcrumb') ?>
    <?= $this->content ?>
</div>
```

Refreshing the page now gives us a styled set of breadcrumbs on each page.
