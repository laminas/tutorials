# Using laminas-paginator in your Album Module

In this tutorial, we will use the [laminas-paginator component](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-paginator/intro/)
to add a handy pagination controller to the bottom of the album list.

Currently, we only have a handful of albums to display, so showing everything on
one page is not a problem. However, how will the album list look when we have
100 albums or more in our database? The standard solution to this problem is to
split the data up into a number of pages, and allow the user to navigate around
these pages using a pagination control. Just type "Laminas" into Google,
and you can see their pagination control at the bottom of the page:

## Preparation

As before, we are going to use sqlite, via PHP's PDO driver. Create a text file
`data/album-fixtures.sql` with the following contents:

```sql

```

(The test data chosen happens to be the current 150 top iTunes albums at the
time of writing!)

Now create the database using the following:

```bash
$ sqlite data/laminastutorial.db < data/album-fixtures.sql
```

Some systems, including Ubuntu, use the command `sqlite3`; check to see which
one to use on your system.

> ### Using PHP to create the database
>
> If you do not have Sqlite installed on your system, you can use PHP to load
> the database using the same SQL schema file created earlier. Create the file
> `data/load_album_fixtures.php` with the following contents:
>
> ```php
> <?php
> $db = new PDO('sqlite:' . realpath(__DIR__) . '/laminastutorial.db');
> $fh = fopen(__DIR__ . '/album-fixtures.sql', 'r');
> while ($line = fread($fh, 4096)) {
>     $db->exec($line);
> }
> fclose($fh);
> ```
>
> Once created, execute it:
>
> ```bash
> $ php data/load_album_fixtures.php
> ```

This gives us a handy extra 150 rows to play with. If you now visit your album
list at `/album`, you'll see a huge long list of 150+ albums; it's ugly.

## Install laminas-paginator

laminas-paginator is not installed or configured by default, so we will need to do
that. Run the following from the application root:

```bash
$ composer require laminas/laminas-paginator
```

Assuming you followed the [Getting Started tutorial](getting-started/overview.md),
you will be prompted by the [laminas-component-installer](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-component-installer)
plugin to inject `Laminas\Paginator`; be sure to select the option for either
`config/application.config.php` or `config/modules.config.php`; since it is the
only package you are installing, you can answer either "y" or "n" to the "Remember this
option for other packages of the same type" prompt.

> ### Manual configuration
>
> If you are not using laminas-component-installer, you will need to setup
> configuration manually. You can do this in one of two ways:
>
> - Register the `Laminas\Paginator` module in either
>   `config/application.config.php` or `config/modules.config.php`. Make sure
>   you put it towards the top of the module list, before any modules you have
>   defined or third party modules you are using.
> - Alternately, add a new file, `config/autoload/paginator.global.php`, with
>   the following contents:
>
>   ```php
>   <?php
>   use Laminas\Paginator\ConfigProvider;
>   
>   return [
>       'service_manager' => (new ConfigProvider())->getDependencyConfig(),
>   ];
>   ```

Once installed, our application is now aware of laminas-paginator, and even has
some default factories in place, which we will now make use of.

## Modifying the AlbumTable

In order to let laminas-paginator handle our database queries automatically for us,
we will be using the [DbSelect pagination adapter](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-paginator/usage/#the-dbselect-adapter)
This will automatically manipulate and run a `Laminas\Db\Sql\Select` object to
include the correct `LIMIT` and `WHERE` clauses so that it returns only the
configured amount of data for the given page. Let's modify the `fetchAll` method
of the `AlbumTable` model, so that it can optionally return a paginator object:

```php
// in module/Album/src/Model/AlbumTable.php:
namespace Album\Model;

use RuntimeException;
use Laminas\Db\ResultSet\ResultSet;
use Laminas\Db\Sql\Select;
use Laminas\Db\TableGateway\TableGatewayInterface;
use Laminas\Paginator\Adapter\DbSelect;
use Laminas\Paginator\Paginator;

class AlbumTable
{
    /* ... */

    public function fetchAll($paginated = false)
    {
        if ($paginated) {
            return $this->fetchPaginatedResults();
        }

        return $this->tableGateway->select();
    }

    private function fetchPaginatedResults()
    {
        // Create a new Select object for the table:
        $select = new Select($this->tableGateway->getTable());

        // Create a new result set based on the Album entity:
        $resultSetPrototype = new ResultSet();
        $resultSetPrototype->setArrayObjectPrototype(new Album());

        // Create a new pagination adapter object:
        $paginatorAdapter = new DbSelect(
            // our configured select object:
            $select,
            // the adapter to run it against:
            $this->tableGateway->getAdapter(),
            // the result set to hydrate:
            $resultSetPrototype
        );

        $paginator = new Paginator($paginatorAdapter);
        return $paginator;
    }

    /* ... */
}
```

This will return a fully configured `Paginator` instance. We've already told the
`DbSelect` adapter to use our created `Select` object, to use the adapter that
the `TableGateway` object uses, and also how to hydrate the result into a
`Album` entity in the same fashion as the `TableGateway` does. This means that
our executed and returned paginator results will return `Album` objects in
exactly the same fashion as the non-paginated results.

## Modifying the AlbumController

Next, we need to tell the album controller to provide the view with a
`Pagination` object instead of a `ResultSet`. Both these objects can by iterated
over to return hydrated `Album` objects, so we won't need to make many changes
to the view script:


```php
// in module/Album/src/Controller/AlbumController.php:

/* ... */

public function indexAction()
{
    // Grab the paginator from the AlbumTable:
    $paginator = $this->table->fetchAll(true);

    // Set the current page to what has been passed in query string,
    // or to 1 if none is set, or the page is invalid:
    $page = (int) $this->params()->fromQuery('page', 1);
    $page = ($page < 1) ? 1 : $page;
    $paginator->setCurrentPageNumber($page);

    // Set the number of items per page to 10:
    $paginator->setItemCountPerPage(10);

    return new ViewModel(['paginator' => $paginator]);
}

/* ... */
```

Here we are getting the configured `Paginator` object from the `AlbumTable`, and
then telling it to use the page that is optionally passed in the querystring
`page` parameter (after first validating it). We are also telling the paginator
we want to display 10 albums per page.

## Updating the View Script

Now, tell the view script to iterate over the `pagination` view variable, rather
than the `albums` variable:

```php
<?php // in module/Album/view/album/album/index.phtml:
$title = 'My albums';
$this->headTitle($title);
?>
<h1><?= $this->escapeHtml($title); ?></h1>
<p>
    <a href="<?= $this->url('album', ['action' => 'add']) ?>">Add new album</a>
</p>

<table class="table">
    <tr>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Artist</th>
        <th>&nbsp;</th>
    </tr>
    <?php foreach ($this->paginator as $album) : // <-- change here! ?>
        <tr>
            <td><?= $this->escapeHtml($album->title) ?></td>
            <td><?= $this->escapeHtml($album->artist) ?></td>
            <td>
                <a href="<?= $this->url('album', ['action' => 'edit', 'id' => $album->id]) ?>">Edit</a>
                <a href="<?= $this->url('album', ['action' => 'delete', 'id' => $album->id]) ?>">Delete</a>
            </td>
        </tr>
    <?php endforeach; ?>
</table>
```

Checking the `/album` route on your website should now give you a list of just
10 albums, but with no method to navigate through the pages. Let's correct that
now.

## Creating the Pagination Control Partial

Much like we created a custom breadcrumbs partial to render our breadcrumb in
the [navigation tutorial](navigation.md#adding-breadcrumbs), we need to create a
custom pagination control partial to render our pagination control just the way
we want it. Again, because we are using Bootstrap, this will primarily involve
outputting correctly formatted HTML. Let's create the partial in the
`module/Application/view/partial/` folder, so that we can use the control in all
our modules:

```php
<?php // in module/Application/view/partial/paginator.phtml: ?>
<?php if ($this->pageCount): ?>
<nav>
  <ul class="pagination">
  <!-- Previous page link -->
  <?php if (isset($this->previous)): ?>
    <li class="page-item">
      <a class="page-link" href="<?= $this->url($this->route, [], ['query' => ['page' => $this->previous]]) ?>">
      <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  <?php else: ?>
    <li class="page-item disabled">
      <a class="page-link" href="#">
      <span aria-hidden="true">&laquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  <?php endif ?>

  <!-- Numbered page links -->
  <?php foreach ($this->pagesInRange as $page): ?>
    <?php if ($page !== $this->current): ?>
      <li class="page-item">
        <a class="page-link" href="<?= $this->url($this->route, [], ['query' => ['page' => $page]]) ?>">
          <?= $page ?>
        </a>
      </li>
    <?php else: ?>
      <li class="page-item active">
        <a class="page-link" href="#"><?= $page ?></a>
      </li>
    <?php endif ?>
  <?php endforeach ?>

  <!-- Next page link -->
  <?php if (isset($this->next)): ?>
    <li class="page-item">
      <a class="page-link" href="<?= $this->url($this->route, [], ['query' => ['page' => $this->next]]) ?>">
      <span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  <?php else: ?>
    <li class="page-item disabled">
      <a class="page-link" href="#">
      <span aria-hidden="true">&raquo;</span>
        <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
      </a>
    </li>
  <?php endif ?>
  </ul>
</nav>
<?php endif ?>
```

This partial creates a pagination control with links to the correct pages (if
there is more than one page in the pagination object). It will render a previous
page link (and mark it disabled if you are at the first page), then render a
list of intermediate pages (that are passed to the partial based on the
rendering style; we'll pass that to the view helper in the next step). Finally,
it will create a next page link (and disable it if you're at the end). Notice
how we pass the page number via the `page` querystring parameter which we have
already told our controller to use to display the current page.

### Using the PaginationControl View Helper

To page through the albums, we need to invoke the
[paginationControl view helper](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-paginator/usage/#rendering-pages-with-view-scripts)
to display our pagination control:

```php
<?php
// In module/Album/view/album/album/index.phtml:
// Add at the end of the file after the table:
?>
<?= $this->paginationControl(
    // The paginator object:
    $this->paginator,
    // The scrolling style:
    'sliding',
    // The partial to use to render the control:
    'partial/paginator',
    // The route to link to when a user clicks a control link:
    ['route' => 'album']
) ?>
```

The above echoes the `paginationControl` helper, and tells it to use our
paginator instance, the [sliding scrolling style](https://docs.laminas.dev/laminas-paginator/advanced/#custom-scrolling-styles),
our paginator partial, and which route to use for generating links. Refreshing
your application now should give you Bootstrap-styled pagination controls!
